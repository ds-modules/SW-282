Here's how we do things: we work with the `plt` module (we imported matplotlib as `plt`, so that's the name we're going to use now), adding things to our plot one by one. Then, when we're done adding all of the things we want to add, we call `plt.show()` to display our plot with all of its features!\n",

    "plt.<...> # Adding things to our plot\n",

That is a special command in Jupyter Notebooks that tells the notebook to display our graphs right below the cell in which they're generated.

    "Although it may seem logical to want as many bins as possible, it is in fact true that having too many bins may lead you to draw conclusions from your data that aren't valid. For example, with 20 bins we see a small dip just after \\\\$40,000. However, this could just be a peculiarity due to random chance of our data. It is always a dilemma when drawing histograms to know how many bins to use; in the end, the best idea is to use enough that you see a good trend, but not so many that the trend has lots of hills and valleys. \n",
