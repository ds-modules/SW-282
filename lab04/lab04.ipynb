One such technique is the **bootstrap**, in which we use data already collected to generate new samples in an attempt to estimate the value of a **population parameter**.\n",

In this example we will use $n=5$ resamples, although normal bootstrapping procedures resample on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of times.\n",
